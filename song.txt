Insane, inside the danger gets me high
Can't help myself got secrets I cant tell
I love the smell of gasoline
I light the match to taste the heat

I've always liked to play with fire
Play whith fire
I've always liked to play with fire
I ride the edge my speed goes in the red

Hot blood these veins my pleasure is their pain
I love to watch the castles burn
These golden ashes turn to dirt
I've always liked to play with fire

Play whith fire
Play whith fire
Fire, fire
I've always liked to play with fire

Watching as the flames get higher
I've always liked to play with fire
Right of passage classic maverick
Match in the gas tank oh that's wretched Unstoppable legendary animals
